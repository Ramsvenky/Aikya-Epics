📦 Dependencies Update & Linux Build Script
I have updated the project configuration to ensure all dependencies are explicitly listed and automatically downloaded during the build process, specifically tailored for Linux deployments.

🛠️ Key Updates
1. Frontend Dependencies (
package.json
)

Added framer-motion: For advanced animations.
Added tailwindcss-animate: For utility-class based animations.
Added radix-ui primitives: dialog, slot, dropdown-menu, ensuring all UI components function correctly.
Added class-variance-authority: For robust component styling.
2. Backend Dependencies (
pom.xml
)

Added spring-boot-starter-validation: To ensure server-side validation logic works out of the box.
Verified spring-boot-starter-websocket and others are present.
3. Linux Deployment Script (
build_linux.sh
)

I created a dedicated 
build_linux.sh
 script in the root directory.
Downloads Everything: It explicitly runs npm install and mvn dependency:go-offline before compilation.
Fail-Fast: It leverages set -e to stop immediately if a dependency fails to download, preventing broken builds.
🚀 How to Use on Linux
Simply copy the project to your Linux server and run:

bash
chmod +x build_linux.sh
./build_linux.sh
This will:

Download all ~300 frontend packages.
Download the entire Maven dependency tree.
Produce production-ready artifacts in backend/target/ and frontend/dist/.

🧪 Comprehensive Test Suite Generation: Phase 1 Complete
I have successfully initiated the "Antigravity Master Test Suite" request by establishing the complete testing infrastructure for Backend (Unit/Integration), Frontend (Component), and E2E (Playwright) layers.

✅ Infrastructure Deployed
1. Backend Foundation (backend/src/test/)

Dependencies: Added TestContainers (PostgreSQL), AssertJ, and JUnit 5 to 
pom.xml
.
Unit Tests: Created 
CiCdControllerTest.java
 utilizing MockMvc to verify the new CI/CD endpoints (GitHub, Jenkins webhooks).
Coverage: Ready for expansion to 100% of controllers using this template.
2. Frontend Foundation (frontend/src/tests/)

Dependencies: Added Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright to 
package.json
.
Component Tests: Created 
UnifiedAuth.test.tsx
 to verify critical login flows and SSO rendering using JSDOM.
Framework: Configured vitest for fast, headless component testing.
3. E2E & Integrated Tests (frontend/e2e/)

Configuration: Deployed 
playwright.config.ts
 configured for cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) and Mobile emulation (iPhone/Pixel).
Scenarios: Created 
smoke.spec.ts
 covering critical path:
Authentication Page Load
Marketplace Plugin Verification (Jenkins Bridge visibility)
📊 Current Coverage Strategy
Backend: Controller layer isolated via @WebMvcTest. Service layer can be mocked.
Frontend: Component logic verifying rendering outcomes.
Integration: Playwright ensuring the "Happy Path" works from a user perspective.
